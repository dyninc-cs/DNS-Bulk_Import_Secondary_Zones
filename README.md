    This script does a bulk import of secondary zones.
    
    The zone name of each new secondary zone needs to be specified
    in a text file containing one zone per line.

    A configuration file called config.cfg containing DynECT
    login credentials, one or more masters, and optionally a
    TSIG key should exist in the same directory.
    The file config.cfg takes the format:

    [Dynect]
    cn: [customer name]
    un: [username]
    pw: [password]
    ip: [one or more comma separated A or AAAA records]
    tsig: [TSIG key]

    Usage: %perl ibsz.pl -F FILE [options]

    Options
        -f, --file FILE         Specify the text file containing a list of zone names
        -t, --tsig              Indicate whether TSIG key is included in config.cfg
        -h, --help              Show this help message and exit
